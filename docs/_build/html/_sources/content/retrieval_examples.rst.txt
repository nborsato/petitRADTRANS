Retrieval Examples
==================

In this section we will give two fully imlemented examples of
retrievals, using synthetic JWST observations. One retrieval for
emission and one for transmission spectra.  These are the retrievals
reported on in the `petitRADTRANS paper
<http://abcd.efgh>`_.

In addition we also give some implemented examples on how to analyze
the results, by producing contribution functions, corner plots and
pressure-temperature confidene envelopes.
